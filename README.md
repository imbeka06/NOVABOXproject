# NOVABOXproject

Key Features Implemented:
Multi-Condition Accident Detection

Impact Force: Checks for >3G acceleration (adjustable).

Sudden Stop: Detects speed drop from >60 km/h to 0 in <0.5 sec.

Rollover: Monitors tilt angle (>90Â°).

False-Alarm Prevention: Requires at least two conditions to confirm a crash.

Emergency Actions

Logs crash data (time, location, impact force, tilt angle).

Sends SMS alerts via GSM with Google Maps link.

Triggers a buzzer for nearby notification.

Hardware Compatibility

Works with MPU9250 (accelerometer/gyroscope).

Uses NEO-6M GPS for speed/location.

Supports SIM800L GSM for alerts

How to Test & Calibrate:
Adjust Thresholds in the #define section based on real-world testing.

Example: Reduce CRASH_IMPACT_THRESHOLD to 2.5G if too sensitive.

Test False Positives:

Simulate potholes (short spikes <2G) to ensure no false alarms.

GPS/GSM Validation:

Ensure GPS gets a fix outdoors.

Test SMS alerts with a valid SIM card

Wiring Guide:
Component	Arduino Nano ESP32 Pin
MPU9250 SDA	A4
MPU9250 SCL	A5
GPS RX	TX1 (Pin 17)
GPS TX	RX1 (Pin 16)

LAST STEP:
Flash this code to your Arduino Nano ESP32 using VS Code + PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.

Test with simulated crashes (e.g., shake the sensor violently for impact + tilt).

Optimize thresholds for your specific vehicle dynamics.
